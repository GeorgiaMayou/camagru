# Camagru
Camagru Project @WeThinkCode

This project is our introduction to web development as well as OOP.

The project itself combines aspects of both Snapchat (superposable images
and live feed from the webcam) as well as Instagram (Gallery as well as Liking
and Commenting on photos).

The information about the users as well as all the images are all stored in a
database that is accessed using the PDO method.
